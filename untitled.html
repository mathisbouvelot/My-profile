               <h2>Series and films</h2>
    <p>
               The third passion I wanted to talk about is series and films. And thats why I choosed Netflix as my favorite website. I like to watch series very oftenly like Peaky Blinders, Narcos or Prison Break, and actually, I can't choose my favorite between these 3 ones.
